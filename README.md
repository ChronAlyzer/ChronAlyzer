### ChronAlyzer ðŸ‘‹

Motivation: The circadian rhythm is of central importance for living organisms and allows them to adjust their physiological parameters to recurring environmental changes. It is characterized by a 24-hour rhythm triggered by the day-night cycle. A facing challenge is the visualization and characterization of rhythmic signals generated by cellular reporter systems, employing clock controlled rhythmic Luciferase activity or GFP expression, as only limited software are available for the determination of the physical parameters of such signals. 

Result: Here we present the software ChronAlyzer, which is applicable for the processing and characterization of rhythmic signals. It allows the selection and grouping of technical and biological replicates as well as an interactive and transparent processing of comprehensive datasets.
